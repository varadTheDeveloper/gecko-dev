// Phase 7.4 benchmark: fs.*Sync read/write/append/exists/mkdir/rm/stat
// throughput. Forge exposes these as globalThis.fs (Phase 7.3, now
// real-build-confirmed -- see Fs.md); Node/Bun expose the same shape via
// require("fs") (Fs.md's Design Goals deliberately mirror Node's own
// naming/defaults for exactly this reason), so one shim line makes this
// script runnable unmodified on all three -- closing the "filesystem
// operations" gap every benchmark report since Phase 0 has had to flag as
// not-yet-benchmarkable (see run-benchmarks.ps1's former scope note, now
// updated to reflect this script's existence).
//
// Two passes, deliberately weighted differently:
//   1. A write/read round-trip loop -- the hot path most real fs usage
//      actually spends time in -- reusing one file across all ITERATIONS
//      iterations (not one file per iteration), so this measures per-call
//      API/syscall overhead, not filesystem-metadata or directory-entry
//      growth.
//   2. A single lighter pass over appendFileSync/existsSync/mkdirSync/
//      rmSync/statSync -- enough to exercise every remaining method in
//      Fs.md's Public API at least once, without pretending these are
//      equally hot-path operations (they're not, in any real workload).
//
// Deliberately does NOT remove fs-bench-scratch (the directory itself)
// when done: Fs.md's own Non-Goals section is explicit that directory
// removal is out of scope for Phase 7 (File::Remove's Win32 backend is
// DeleteFileW, which cannot remove a directory) -- so there is nothing in
// today's fs.*Sync surface this script could call to clean that up even
// if it wanted to. The scratch dir is reused (not recreated) on every
// run, so this doesn't grow unbounded across repeated benchmark runs.
