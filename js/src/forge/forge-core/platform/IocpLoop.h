// NOT VERIFIED BY COMPILATION. Unlike TimerScheduler (pure logic, fully
// tested under g++/clang++ + ASan/UBSan in a Linux sandbox — see
// HISTORY.md), the IOCP calls here cannot be compiled or run outside a real
// Windows toolchain. This needs to be built and exercised on the project
// owner's machine before it's trusted, the same way the earlier
// VectorSmokeTest.cpp MSVC error was only found once actually built there.

/// `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` can be reinterpret_cast back to the
/// containing `IoCompletion`, and from there — once that owning struct also
/// puts itself first — back to the request-specific struct). This is the
/// standard zero-virtual-call IOCP idiom: the callback pointer lives inline
/// right next to the OVERLAPPED, so completing an operation costs one
/// function-pointer call, not a vtable lookup.
///
/// `IocpLoop` itself never allocates or owns one of these — the caller
/// (whatever issued the async operation) owns its lifetime and must keep it
